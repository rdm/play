{"name":"Play","tagline":"just testing","body":"### So, yeah, testing...\r\nHypothetically speaking, I am in control of this content. But that means also that I need a playground where I can try things and see how markdown relates to displayed content.\r\n```\r\nSo... ... you know... testing... \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Things I think I know\r\nI think that this automated system is going to be creating and updating a branch named `gh-pages`. And, I think github has a \"Jekyll\" tool designed to give me an emulation of how changes to that branch will look when published as http://rdm.github.io/play (and something similar for other projects - the project name in github will replace \"play\" here, since this project is named \"play\"). Also, the author of Jekyll is Tom Preston-Werner - that might be handy for searching for docs or other information. I think Jekyll was designed to support \"blog-like\" publishing, and to show how different templates will look with current content.\r\n\r\nThis markdown system uses twitter-like handles (@rdm for example) to refer to github user profiles.\r\n\r\nDoc links (hopefully these last long enough to be useful):\r\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator\r\nhttps://help.github.com/categories/20/articles\r\nhttp://help.github.com/pages\r\nhttp://pages.github.com/\r\n@support","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
